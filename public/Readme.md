TeacherHub
Project Description
TeacherHub is a comprehensive educational platform designed to empower teachers and students by providing a centralized, all-in-one solution for class management. Teachers can easily upload lesson notes, administer tests, and monitor student progress. A key feature of the platform is an integrated AI tool that assists teachers in planning lessons, making the preparation process more efficient and creative.

For students, the platform offers a streamlined experience to access course materials, submit assignments, and track their own academic journey.

Features
Teacher Dashboard: A dedicated interface for teachers to manage all their classes and students.

Dynamic Content Management: Teachers can upload and organize lesson notes in various formats, accessible to students anytime.

Assessment Tools: Create and deploy quizzes and tests to evaluate student understanding.

Student Progress Monitoring: A clear and intuitive view for teachers to track individual student performance and overall class progress.

AI-Powered Lesson Planning: A unique feature that uses generative AI to help teachers draft and structure lesson plans.

Secure File Storage: All lesson notes and educational materials are securely stored and delivered via Firebase Storage.

Authentication: Secure user sign-up and login for both teachers and students using Firebase Authentication.

Technologies Used
Frontend:

[Your Frontend Framework/Library, e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js]

[Any other frontend libraries you used]

Backend & Database:

Firebase: This project is built entirely on the Firebase ecosystem for a serverless, scalable backend.

Firebase Authentication: Handles all user authentication and role-based access.

Cloud Firestore: The main database for storing all structured data like users, classes, assignments, and grades.

Firebase Storage: Used to store and serve all uploaded files, such as lesson notes and student submissions.

Cloud Functions: Deployed to run the AI lesson-planning tool. They act as the bridge between the teacher's request and the generative AI model.

AI Integration:

 Gemini API for generating lesson plans and content.
